                    <p>Bootstrap is a framework that was created to help keep consistency and ease while creating responsive mobile frist webites. It was created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a way to reduce the amount of inconsistencies within layouts and create a "one stop shop" for anything coding related! The beauty of this framework is that it is not only open source for anyone to access, but it has plenty of instuctions and explinations on how to use each component of bootstrap and has plenty of guides to help new users. All in all, Bootstrap is AMAZING!! </p>

This can be useful wehn trying to provide specific information to a user on any given site. Not only does it allow for specific information to be given based to the desiered button/ link, but i also help the user by only giving them the informaation they require at that moment. Ths can help by not overwhelming a user with to much information they are not looking for.
