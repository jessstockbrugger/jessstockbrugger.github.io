Jessica's Webiste Portfolio

Overview
    I decided to use the bootstrap framework to create my webiste portfolio. This was because it would:

        #1 It had HTML and CSS already pre-coded to make creating the basic structure faster
        #2 It helped to have an already established flexbox framework to be able to use classes to extablish how code would be displayed on the site before adding my own CSS
        #3 It helped to be bale to adapt all structure to be responsive for all screen sizes

    After creating the basic structure for my site I started adding more of the essential code and design elements to be able to start making the webiste look almost exaclty like the mock-up. Once all photos and content was added I began to style the webiste with my own CSS to make the the Website Portfolio look the way I had wanted it to. 

Issue #1
    I did have some difficulty with creating an image gallery like scene on page 1 of the mockup. This was because all photos in the gallery were different heights and different widths. I tried a variety of methods to create this gallery however nothing I did could come up making thr gallery look exaclty like the mockup. After struggling with that I decidd to remove it entierly and just add one photo that would evenly match with with the text displayed next to it. This was only an easy fix, however I am disapointed I could not create a gallery like I had hoped for......

Issue #2
    Another challenge I faced was failry simple (when I figured out the issue) however I did struggle alot with this. Ont he "About Me" page I have a image being displayed with a paragraph of text next to it. I knew that I wanted that text to be displayed:

        a. In the center of the collumn
        b. And in the middle of the collumn

    Although the answer was simple I still struggled. I originally tried usin the bootstrap classes to fix this issue but nothing I did would work. I then tried adding my own CSS to fix the issue but I found that would (of course) overide any boostrap CSS that was being implemented. After hours struggling with something to simple! I realized I was missing a very important key class was would put the whole thing into motion! Using the classes:
        
        .text-center
        .d-flex 
        .justify-content-center 
        .flex-column 
        .align-items-center

    I was able to overcome this issue and had a very happy "aha!" moment!

Issue #3 
    A big struggle I had was getting text to display over an image in the way I had wanted it to! I tried a variety of ways from creating background images, to using the transform properties, to basic padding and margin. In the end I was able to make it work in a way I was satisfied with. I ended up using:

        {bottom:;}
        {top:;}
        {left:;}
        {transform: translate;}

    CSS properties be make this happen. And although it is not perfect to say the least and does not match the mockup exaclty, I was pleased with what I was able to do adn was satisfied with the overall outcome. 

What I learned
    Overall I learned alot of things while making this webiste. 
    
        Firstly, nothing is perfect, and if I am loosing sleep over one simple coding issue, get it to where I am happy and move on. I created this mock-up about a month ago thinking I made it simple enough to give me a challenge but not to much of a struggle. I am happy that I did, because I am alwasy pushing myself to be better and do better wherever I can. I knew when I started the coding process it wasn't going to be easy adn it wasn't, but non the less I persevered and learnt a variety of new skills by doing so. 

        Secondly, struggles are a good thing. Not only did those struggles push me to be better but pushed me to learn new skills and most importantly re-enforce those skills I have learnt up to this point like flexbox, grid systems, image responsivitey, boostrap, animation and so much more! 

        Finally, the bootstrap frame work is great, but never perfect. This meaning that bootstrap is fantastic to create a basic HTML structure, but not as a final product. It was extremly useful to have that tool in my "toolbox" to use but there was alot that needed to be fixed for my personal webiste. There are good things and bad things about Bootstrap but overall can't do everything you might expect of it. 

    Overall, I learned so much be not only doing thid assignment, but taking this course and overall program. The skills I learned along the way has helped immensely to start with an idea, design it myself using specific theories and then put those ideas into action all by scratch!
